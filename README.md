## Introduction

Facebook has become quite popular in the recent few years with people all over the world using it as a medium to share their status, thoughts and pictures with their friends. With the mobile app , it has become even more popular and easier to access. People from all age groups are connected to Facebook, however there are certain differences in their way of using it such as with respect to initiating friendships and sending likes . We are trying to study the dataset provided to identify certain patterns with respect to how the users are making use of this most popular social networking app depending on their age group, gender etc

I have done an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) for this Facebook data to find the most active users based on their age, gender across 99000 users. Also identifying the patterns for Inactive users. Usage in Facebook is based on their activity on the tenure, Likes given , Likes Received , Friendships and Friendships Initiated. With the mobile app being active as well, this data was analysed for Web and Mobile usage

Python is one of the most popular languages used by data scientists and software developers alike for data science tasks. It can be used to predict outcomes, automate tasks, streamline processes, and offer business intelligence insights.

1. NumPy (Numerical Python) is a perfect tool for scientific computing and performing basic and advanced array operations.

2. Pandas is a perfect tool for data wrangling or munging. It is designed for quick and easy data manipulation, reading, aggregation, and visualization.

3. Pandas Profiling report serves as this excellent EDA tool that can offer the following benefits: overview, variables, interactions, correlations, missing values, and a sample of the data.

Data Visualization
<![endif]-->

1. Matplotlib is one of those plotting libraries that are really useful in data science projects

2. Seaborn is based on Matplotlib and serves as a useful Python machine learning tool for visualizing statistical models â€“ heatmaps and other types of visualizations that summarize data and depict the overall distribution

EDA with Python

After cleaning up the data (deleting, replacing, handling the outliers etc) and pandas profiling to look at the bigger picture, moved on to the EDA. Created Various age groups to categorize minors, younger work force, senior citizens etc. Also identified the Inactive users and saw their pattern as well

Analyzed the data using univariate, bivariate analysis using Gender & Age. Also used Groupby to make the analysis more quicker

SWOT Analysis

Summarized the EDA with SWTO analysis as it is quick and easy to understand. It clearly showed where the gender-age group where they are active, loose steam and inactive as well

Suggested ways to increase the Facebook popularity based on the weaker areas and general recommendation to increase the Facebook usage.
